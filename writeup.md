Visually, at least three cars can be identified from the point clouds of different angles, regardless of distances. The wheels and back mirrors can also be determined from most images. Even though downsampling may lose info, most cars can still be identified from most images. The features are stable over point clouds, height, and intensity maps. Also, the observations are stable via model-based object detections.
